# Maze Generation and Solution with Graph Theory

ðŸ“Œ This is a comprehensive project developed as part of the **Industrial Engineering Graduation Project** at **BoÄŸaziÃ§i University**.

The project focuses on generating mazes of varying structural complexity using **graph-based algorithms**, and solving them through **classical** and **reinforcement learning** techniques in specific **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**. After generation and solution processes, the mazes are **sampled and analyzed** to understand how structural features affect solvability and agent behavior.

## Maze Generation Algorithms

Maze generation is the core of this project. All mazes are generated on **grid graphs**, where nodes represent cells and edges represent possible passages. The algorithms vary in their logic, ranging from randomized traversal to minimum spanning tree-based structures.

## Maze Solution Algorithms

Once mazes are generated, different algorithms are applied to solve them and analyze behavior under structural differences. This includes classical search techniques and reinforcement learning:

## Maze Visualizations and Animations

To better understand the behavior of different generation and solution algorithms, we have included a collection of sample visualizations and animations.

Explore these examples in the [MazeAnimations/Outputs](https://github.com/lmfaraday/Maze-Generation-Algorithms-Using-Graph-Theory/tree/main/MazeAnimations/Outputs) folder in the repository. They showcase how the mazes evolve during generation and how various solvers navigate through them.

## ðŸ“Š Data & Evaluation

All generated mazes are **sampled** and **evaluated** based on their:  
- Structural complexity  
- Solvability under different algorithms  
- Agent performance and behavior (classical vs. DQN)  

These analyses helped understand how maze structure affects exploration patterns and solution difficulty.
