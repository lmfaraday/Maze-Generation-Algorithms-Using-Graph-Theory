# Maze Generation and Solution with Graph Theory

ðŸ“Œ This is a comprehensive project developed as part of the **Industrial Engineering Graduation Project** at **BoÄŸaziÃ§i University**.

The project focuses on generating mazes of varying structural complexity using **graph-based algorithms**, and solving them through **classical** and **reinforcement learning** techniques such as **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**. After generation and solution processes, the mazes are **sampled and analyzed** to understand how structural features affect solvability and agent behavior.

## Maze Generation Algorithms

Maze generation is the core of this project. All mazes are generated on **grid graphs**, where nodes represent cells and edges represent possible passages. The algorithms vary in their logic, ranging from randomized traversal to minimum spanning tree-based structures.

Generation algorithms included in this project, in specific:

### Prim-Based

- ðŸ”— [Initialized Prim*](MazeGenerationAlgorithms/InitializedPrim.py)  
- ðŸ”— [Loop Prim*](MazeGenerationAlgorithms/LoopPrim.py)  
- ðŸ”— [Stochastic Prim*](MazeGenerationAlgorithms/StochasticPrim.py)

### Hunt and Kill-Based

## Maze Solution Algorithms

Once mazes are generated, different algorithms are applied to solve them and analyze behavior under structural differences. This includes classical search techniques and reinforcement learning:

- ðŸ”— [A\*](MazeSolutionAlgorithms/AStar.py)  
- ðŸ”— [Breadth First Search (BFS)](MazeSolutionAlgorithms/BreadthFirstSearch.py)  
- ðŸ”— [Depth First Search (DFS)](MazeSolutionAlgorithms/DepthFirstSearch.py)  
- ðŸ”— [Hybrid Search*](MazeSolutionAlgorithms/HybridSearch.py)  
- ðŸ”— [Random Walk](MazeSolutionAlgorithms/RandomWalk.py)  
- ðŸ”— [Hand on Wall](MazeSolutionAlgorithms/HandOnWall.py)  
- ðŸ”— [Deep Q-Learning (DQN)*](MazeSolutionAlgorithms/DeepQNetwork.ipynb)

## ðŸ“Š Data & Evaluation

All generated mazes are **sampled** and **evaluated** based on their:
- Structural complexity
- Solvability under different algorithms
- Agent performance and behavior (classical vs. DQN)

These analyses helped understand how maze structure affects exploration patterns and solution difficulty.
