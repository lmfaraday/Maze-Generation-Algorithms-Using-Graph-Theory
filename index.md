# Homeworks and Project

## Homework 1

This homework uses simple machine learning techniques to predict antenna performance for 5G systems, focusing on the S11 parameter for signal reflection. By applying PCA and regression, we simplify complex relationships between antenna geometry and behavior. The repo includes code, data analysis, and a report with insights.

## Homework 2

This homework leverages sports forecasting to explore real-time market dynamics, using in-game betting odds as predictive indicators for soccer match outcomes. By analyzing odds, betting trends, and game events, it investigates biases and inefficiencies in market predictions. Tasks involve data visualization, decision tree modeling, and sensitivity analysis to understand bookmaker accuracy and betting behavior. The repository includes detailed code, data analysis, and a comprehensive report summarizing methodologies, findings, and insights.

## Project

This project focuses on developing a betting strategy for soccer match outcomes, emphasizing multi-class classification and real-time decision-making. By leveraging decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost, it predicts match results (home win, draw, or away win) using live betting odds and game dynamics. The analysis explores odds behavior, market biases, and the impact of game events, combining statistical insights with machine learning to maximize accuracy and return. A detailed report presents the methodologies, findings, and actionable strategies for effective sports forecasting.
